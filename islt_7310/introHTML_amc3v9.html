    My name is April Campbell. I am a student at the University of Missouri pursuing a Specialist of Education in Learning Technology. I received my Bachelor degree from the University of Memphis. I received my Masterâ€™s degree from Arkansas State University. I am an Adult Education instructor at a local community college in Mississippi. I have been in the education sector for about 7 years now.  I enjoy reading and watching television with my family. I recently just became a first time mother and I am super excited about that. I am interested in seeing how I am able to balance motherhood, school and my personal life. I am married to a fellow educator. He is a wonderful support system and its nice having someone who understands from an education perspective. I am a novice when it comes to building webpages and coding so I am a bit nervous about this course. But I am fully prepared to try my best and reach out for assistance if needed. As a teacher, I believe many students are afraid to ask questions but there is no shame in getting clarity for better understanding.
