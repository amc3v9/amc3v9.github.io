<h3>I am excited about teaching you how to write an efficent essay </h3>

<p>My name is April Campbell. I am an Adult Education instructor from Clarksdale, Mississippi. I have been in education for 7 years. I received my Bachelor degree from the University of Memphis and received my Master degree from Arkansas State University. <br> During my tenure as an Adult Education instructor, I have had the pleasure of acting as an Adult Education online education consultant as well as being the Lead instructor at my local community college. <br> Through my thorough teaching, my students receive some of the highest scores in the state of Mississippi on their Language Arts-Writing HSE (High School Equivalency) examinations.  I love education and I love helping adults achieve their goal of receiving their high school diplomas. </p>
