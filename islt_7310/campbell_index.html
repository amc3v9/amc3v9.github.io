<body> <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>

<h3>Are you an Adult Education student who would like to gain more insight on passing the writing part of your HiSet Language Arts-Writing exam? I am here to help you with your essay writing skills. I am excited about teaching you how to write an efficent essay. </h3></body> 
<p>The HiSet Language Arts-Writing includes 50 multiple choice questions and an essay. The writing portion asks you to write an essay in response to an essay prompt. You will need to generate and organize your thoughts and you will be graded based on development, organization, language facility and the use of writing conventions.  Although many students find success with the multiple-choice portion, many find the essay portion difficult. Here, you can learn how to write a successful essay before you take the subtest. I will demonstrate all the components of a successful essay and how to write one, simply and clearly. The goal of this website is to give fluent writing suggestions and tips to assist with students increasing their written portion score. The goal here is to cover the content areas of the essay question for more thorough clarity. The objectives of our learning content will focus on content, organization, language, and grammar and writing strategies.</p>
